For instance, if you add `resp0_user`, you can access in the second, third, etc. backends in Lua to `req:params('Resp0_user')`.The format of the parameters must start with `respX_` or `respX`, where `X` is the backend index from which you want to take the parameter. If you don't set the underscore `_`, you set the whole payload as a parameter. For instance, `resp0` sets a parameter `Resp0` to use in Lua or a Body generator and contains **the entire payload of the backend 0** (as a string). In this extreme case, you must use `no-op` in the backend's output (even the endpoint has a `json` output encoding) and you should access the value in Lua or a plugin. Note that access to **nested parameters** uses a single string with the dot notation inside, e.g.: `req_params['Resp0_f1.f2.f3']` (CEL and Security Policies), or `{{ index .req_params \"Resp0_f1.f2.f3\" }}` (body generators).\n\nSee: https://www.krakend.io/docs/endpoints/sequential-proxy/",
